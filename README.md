# Hangman-Game
This Hangman Game was developed by Dylan Glover in February of 2018 while under the educational guidance of the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.

The first version of the game is mostly a success, key issues are:
*Number of Guesses is subtracted even on a correct guess
*When restarting the game, word does not change
